# Introduction

NTE is an abbreviation for NRAF Template Engine, and is available on npm under `@nraf/nte`.

NTE takes inspiation from template engines like, `Nunjucks` and in-turn `Jinja2`, which are just phenominal, but moves away from the idea of template inheriance using `blocks` and instead felicitates the functionality using `partials`, powered by template imports, using the `include` function.
