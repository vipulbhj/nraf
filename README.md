## Not-Really-A-Framework

### What is it:-
**NRAF** a lightweight *NODE* framework which provides an alternate to most of the tools out there like **express**,**fastify**, etc(Just kidding).

The intent of this project is mostly for learning purposes, to serve as an example implementation of most of the big guns out there(mentioned above). NRAF is designed keeping in mind that it can be ***intimidating*** for people(especially new developer's) to take a look under the hood and thus NRAF by its design encourages you to look under the hood and may be learn a new thing or two (or open an issue, so that I can learn a thing or two).

The content, implementation and application of this project is immensely inspired by express and you'll also feel the same while working with it.

### Applications:- 
* Small to medium size projects which you might be hacking together on the weekend. NRAF works immensely well for those apps because of
    * lightweight.
    * extensibility.
    * almost flat learning curve(assuming you have done this before).
* Learning and teaching resource.
* To be transformed into something bigger by extending.

## Getting Started:- 
Current no useful documentation is available for the project, but I am actively working on that(might be work to star the project to keep an eye over it).

But in the mean time, If you one of the brave one's. Look into the example directory in the github repo and open up example.js. You will find comments describing most of the things there are and I have also hacked together a fun example which demonstrates most of the regular bits.

### TL;DR
*The motivation for this came from the constant news of issues with npm ecosystem. As this started catching fire, I tried talking a look inside the express git repo and it was very intmedating, thus I started build this to get ideas on how things might work and come up with implementations of the features from popular frameworks. Soon I realized that there is a huge lack of content for creating apps using node without any framwork. Thus I decided to document everything as I go by learning and exploring new concepts and packages which can be used to make node app without any Framework*


### Features Available :- 
* Create app using the NRAF object.
* Supports GET requests.
* Can write headers and send responses.
* Supports POST requests.

### Coming Soon:- 
* Middleware support (personally I love this feature most about express).
* Additional Features...

## Issues, Suggestions and Other things:-
Pull Requests for anything of the above are appreciated and welcomed immensely.   
**Please just make sure that they are easy to go by, so that it makes my life a little easier and I can approve it faster.**
